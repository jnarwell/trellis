# Trellis Component Library

Welcome to the Trellis component library. This Storybook documents the visual building blocks of the Trellis enterprise data platform.

## What is Trellis?

Trellis is a universal enterprise data platform for product and process data. It uses an event-sourced architecture where entities hold properties and relate to each other through typed relationships.

## Component Categories

### Blocks

Blocks are the primary visual components in Trellis:

- **TableBlock** - Data grid for displaying and managing entity collections
- **FormBlock** - Form interface for creating and editing entities
- **DetailBlock** - Read-only detail view for single entities
- **KanbanBlock** - Board view for workflow management

### Foundations

Design system primitives:

- **Colors** - Trellis color palette
- **Typography** - Font scales and text styles

## Development Status

This component library is under active development. Placeholder stories indicate components that are planned but not yet implemented.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Start Storybook
pnpm --filter @trellis/client storybook
